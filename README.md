# SmartBank ATM

SmartBank ATM is a decentralized application that allows users to interact with their Ethereum accounts, manage deposits and withdrawals, view transaction history, and set up automatic withdrawals. This application provides an easy-to-use interface for managing digital assets and viewing transaction details.

## Description

SmartBank ATM is designed to simulate a traditional ATM experience using Ethereum smart contracts. Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to view their account information, deposit or withdraw ETH, and track their transaction history. Additionally, users can set up automatic withdrawals and manage their recurring payments. This application leverages Ethereum's blockchain to ensure secure and transparent transactions.
